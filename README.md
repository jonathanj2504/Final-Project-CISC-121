Decomposition: Checks in guest, calculates cost, store guest info, search for guest

Pattern: Guests use the same field for info, room price calculation

Abstraction: App hides guest list, and calculation details

Algorithm Design: Input: name, room types, and nights
                  Process: Validate nights, calculate total cost, add guest to guest list, and use linear search to search for guests
                  Output: Check In Summary or results from search
